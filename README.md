oA (OpenApprentice) is a new look on solving a very specific problem:

How do we get people the exact experience necessary to be competent in any given domain and gaining that competence in an effecient, personaized and verifiable manner?

The world today has the technology to literally solve nearly all problems.  From education, to medicine, to space travel and entertainment. From economic disparity within and between countries to income inequility between the the very poorest to the very richest. From agriculture to self-driving vehicles.  The technology exists.

What we are missing are enough competent technicians, leaders, teachers and programmers. We are missing problem solvers, independent thinkers and artist.

OpenApprentice was created on the premise that competence, ability to learn, teach and lead, proven reliability and proven performance are alone the measure of ones value to a company. That with these requisites one's age, color, sex, and even geographic location (in most cases) should not determine or influencec the value to any given project, organization or company.

We believe that when workers have options and know they have options within and for their careers, that this freedom will allow for the utmost ethical, humane and productive ways shown everyday in the everyday action of most human beings. With that freedom and choice of where and who to work for, more good than evil will be affected.

## You can help - contributing to OpenApprentice

We are looking for people who share a similar vision and want to help:

+ Do you want to teach others a subject that you are passionate about?
+ Are you a Python developer for web or data science that has a lot or a little free time to help?
+ Have you built a Rasa based chatbot?
+ Are you a teacher of mathematics?
+ Do you have an interest in developing or have skills using blockchain technology?
+ Do you know Vue?

The above are certain skills we need teachers, people who want experience in doing, and supervisors who can "look over the shoulder and QC/instruct" in these areas.


## What we are building

+ The OpenApprentice.org website itself - current progress can be followed here: https://github.com/OpenApprenticeFoundation/openapprentice-website - this is a Python Flask based website using Vue.
+ The teaching module - many experts in many technical fields are willing to teach others. A methodology on how to teach and the software to implement such a method is being adopted here in oA. We are finishing plans for a upgradable, self-adapting and personalized teaching module to helps students learn any given skill at the exact level of knowledge they require to become competent in that skill. We are solving the problem of tutorials, books, courses and instruction that is either too advanced or too basic for the exact student studying at that exact moment in their career and education. This is in the final planning stages.
+ A highly integrated chatbot using the Open Source Rasa stack. Consider this chatbot to be at once guide, problem solver, and communications agent.  The rasa chat platform can be found at this link: https://rasa.com/products/rasa-stack/
