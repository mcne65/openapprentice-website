			<h1>OpenApprentice</h1>
			<h3 class="h4 center">A new approach to gaining real experience.</h3>
			<p>We're combining new teaching models, novel learning material and basic concepts of the ageless apprenticeship system to help better trained and experienced employees to new jobs and opportunities.
			</p>
			<p>We already thank all those before us who have graciously published their resources for the benefit of all. We build on your work and example as a foundation for our success.</p>

			<h2 class="h1">Our Purpose</h2>
			<h4 class="h4 center">Solving the problem of getting the job done</h4>
			<p>Who solves problems? People. Who hires people? Other people. We noticed the complexity, confusion and weirdness of the relationship between both these peoples. Our purpose is to deliver certainty of what to expect. Simple.</p>
			<p>We want the job to get job. There is a lot of worthy, profitable and necessary work to accomplish. Remove the biases, prejudices, false assertions and politics and we believe everyone in this industry will benefit.</p>

		<!-- For Students Page -->
		<section class="content hide" id="for_students">
			<h2 class="h1">Students</h2>
			<h4 class="h4 center">Acquire competence for real life</h4>
			<p>What matters most is the knowledge you can learn what you need as it's needed. Competence then is related to ones ability to learn. Your ability to learn is connected to your ability to communicate. </p>
			<p>The OpenApprentice system will get you there. You will be confident of your skills and what you can do - each step of the way. And with this you walk your own path forward.</p>

		<!-- For Teachers Page -->
		<section class="content hide" id="for_teachers">
			<h2 class="h1">Teachers and mentors</h2>
			<h4 class="h4 center">Teach for greater and meaningful impact</h4>
			<p>You give your time to create a teaching platform, a method or instruction for others. Sometimes you deliver the impact and help you wanted. Mostly, your efforts fell flat. It wasn't your effort. Or what you were teaching.  It was where and when you taught it.</p>
			<p>The OpenApprentice system we're implementing fixes that. It takes your valuable insights, that you already want to teach others, and places it in front of students exactly when they will most benefit from it. They should know what you know.</p>

		<!-- For Students Page -->
		<section class="content hide" id="for_employers">
			<h2 class="h1">For Employers</h2>
			<h4 class="h4 center">Hire with greater certainty</h4>
			<p>We apprentice them. You hire them. We do it Open Source style. Problems in the world need solving... OpenApprentice is at once a place to truly master and apprentice on real projects, OpenApprentice learners, teachers and employment partners "know that they know" and can perform at each step of their learning experience. OpenApprentice aims to be the standard by which students, employees and employers are judged.</p>
